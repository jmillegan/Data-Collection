# Data-Collection Challenge 11
Used a lot of google on the second notebook. 
Slackflow was used as well and some questions for understanding went to chatcpt
Instructor Michael fixed some of my code on the second assignment
Had much help from my tutor sessions to make my output look as the key, as well as some coding issues i could just not figure out no matter what sources
  I was using.
